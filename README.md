Here are some tasks we are going to work through together in todays session. Each one uses a combination of commands we have covered so far. 

## Task 1 - Setting up a project directory

Here we want to set up a directory ready for a project. 
1. start in the home directory 
2. make a new directory (with a command that won't override a file that already exists) called `NewProject`
3. within that directory make three new ones - `Data`, `Analysis`, `Output`
4. count the number of `fastq` files in the directory `xxxxx`
5. make a sample list of these `fastq` files
6. move the sample list to our `Data` folder
7. check that the file looks correct after moving it by looking in it
8. check the last line(s) of the file and make sure they are complete
9. check what modules are installed on the cluster
10. see if the software `fastqc` is installed



In this script we will do the following:
- make a new directory for our project called 'NewProject'
- produce symbolic links for all of our raw reads in the directory *** into 'NewProject'
